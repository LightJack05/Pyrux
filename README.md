# Pyrux
Pyrux is a teaching tool for teaching people how to program. It offers the possibility to visualize the execution of code by moving a robot through the playing area, picking up chips, and placing them again.
In the end, you need to match the goal layout that is defined in the level you have open.

Pyrux includes a full Python interpreter based on IronPython 3.4. This means it has the full power of a programming language, while still being easy to pick up and also working with standard python programming documentation. The differences are limited to the injected methods for Pyrux movement.

## Pre-Alpha Notice
Pyrux is currently in Pre-Alpha. This means the software is not ready for full release yet. 
Because it is currently not stable, I do not recommend that you use it for production at this point. You may encounter more than just a couple minor bugs.

## Issues/Bugs/Feedback
If you encounter any issues within the software or have any feedback or suggestions, please create an issue on GitHub. I will get to fixing it or reviewing the suggestion as soon as possible.

## What's coming?
Here are a few features that still have to be added to Pyrux (more will be added in the future):

* Tutorial (WIP)
* Proper Code Editor (Thinking of WinUIEdit by BreeceW, https://github.com/BreeceW/WinUIEdit/)
* Tutorial Levels
* Normal Levels

## Open Source Licenses
Pyrux uses these amazing open source projects:

* IronPython 3.4
* WinUI3 and .NET 7
* WinUI3 Community Toolkit
* Newtonsoft JSON

Licenses for them can be found inside the "Open Source Licenses" folder in the repo, as well as in every release past v0.1.1.0 under About>Licenses.
